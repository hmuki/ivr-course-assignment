### IVR Assignment

This repo houses my solutions for the IVR coursework. It involved using the computer vision
library - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) to locate the positions of colored objects and 
ROS(https://www.ros.org/) to direct the end effectors of a robot to reach out to some
designated target objects.
